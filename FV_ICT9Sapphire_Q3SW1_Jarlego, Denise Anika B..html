			<h2>Little Women<br>Based <span>from the wonderful book of Louisa May Alcott</span></h2>
			<p>In the years after the Civil War, Jo March lives in New York and makes her living as a writer,<p> while her sister Amy studies painting in Paris. Amy has a chance encounter with Theodore,<p> a childhood crush who proposed to Jo but was ultimately rejected. Their oldest sibling, Meg, is married to a schoolteacher, while<p> shy sister Beth develops a devastating illness that brings the family back together. The story follows the lives<p> of the four March sisters—Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy—and details their passage from childhood to womanhood. Loosely based<p> on the lives of the author and her three sisters, it is<p> classified as an autobiographical or semi-autobiographical novel.</p>

		<p><h4>Jo March is a dazzling and original invention: bold, outspoken, brave, daring, loyal, cranky, principled, and real. She is a dreamer and a scribbler, happiest at her woodsy hideout by an old cartwheel or holed up in the attic, absorbed in reading or writing, filling page after page with stories or plays.</p></h4>

		<p><h4>Laurie, short for Theodore Laurence, is the March girls' wealthy next-door neighbor. He's a high-spirited young man about the same age as Jo. Until the March girls come along, he's moody, bad-tempered, and often bored. Like many other teenagers, he has plans for his life that are pretty different than his guardian's.</p></h4>

		<p><h4>Meg, the oldest sister, is 16 when the story starts. She is described as a beauty, and manages the household when her mother is absent. She has long brown hair and blue eyes and particularly beautiful hands, and is seen as the prettiest one of the sisters.</p></h4>
